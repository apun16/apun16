### Hi I'm Anushka 👋
---
I'm a developer and CS student @ University of Waterloo. Currently, I'm building projects focused on **accessibility**, **climate**, and **fintech**. Previously, I:
- led case competitions for 5k+ youth teaching business literacy through FUSE and Target Alpha
- developed data analytics dashboards at Nokia & social media distribution tools at Aview
- was selected as a CIW camper (top 10 female CCC scorers in Canada invited to compete at Waterloo for a spot on the EGOI team) 
- built an atmospheric water harvesting device that won 3rd nationally @ the youth impact challenge
- raised 30k+ from Emergent Ventures, 1517 Fund, and more to develop biodegradable hydrogels that serve as an alternative to chemical fertilizers

I love solving puzzles, whether it's debugging code, figuring out logic puzzles, or conquering the latest escape room. Feel free to reach out to me [anushka.punukollu@uwaterloo.ca](mailto:anushka.punukollu@uwaterloo.ca)!
